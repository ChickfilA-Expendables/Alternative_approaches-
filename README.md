# Alternative_approaches-
Other approaches which were tried 


Canny edge detection had problem that it was detecting the edges but with lots of other fine grained details (which would
make the task more difficult). 

Sobel edge detection has problem that it was not accurately mapping the edges and thus a images were merged through the code
to make the edges look more defined. 

Gaussian Blur was used for image smoothning and noise removal but was not a complete success either due to noise build up 
outside the container.
